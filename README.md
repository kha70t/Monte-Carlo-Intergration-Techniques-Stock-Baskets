<h2> Monte Carlo Integration Techniques </h2>
<h3> Executive Summary </h3>
The purpose of this project is to implement
Monte Carlo Integration techniques to explore
and simulate different hypothetical portfoliosâ€™
returns over a specific length of time. Through
different simulations, the project will showcase
various techniques to implement Monte Carlo
simulation based on their specific needs when it
comes to investing. Due to the nature of Monte
Carlo Simulation: this project only focuses on
the performance of each stock, excluding dividends,
reinvestment, and periodic contribution,
while assuming that price reflects macroeconomic
events. The findings showcase how to
use Monte Carlo Simulation to model a few different
hypothetical portfolio mixes to assess the
risks and rewards in a medium timeframe horizon.


<h3> Methodology </h3>
The project utilizes Python and Yahoo Finance API to pull stock data from the S&P 500. Afterward, I build Monte Carlo on various hypothetical stock portfolios, such as Warren Buffet's portfolio (equal-weighted and custom-weighted), a top 20 S&P-500 holding, a random 20 S&P-500 holding, a random 20 Nasdaq holding, or MAG7. 

<h3> The result </h3>
The model hypothesizes that different portfolios could potentially suit different investment goals; for example, an investor who opts for a balanced portfolio that can beat the S&P-500 but is not overly risky can build a basket with the top 20 S&P-500 holdings.

<h3> Further consideration </h3>
This project aims to cater to the average investor who may need more extensive knowledge or time to thoroughly research the stock markets. However, in the future, I would like to enhance and explore further through larger sample sizes, an extended time horizon, and more carefully selected stock baskets for greater accuracy and insight.
